# Body Fat Prediction Project: Project Overview
In this project, I developed a tool for predicting body fat percentage using machine learning techniques. The primary objective was to create an accurate predictive model to help individuals estimate their body fat percentage based on various physical attributes. The project encompassed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and deployment of a prediction web application.

# Project Steps
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Gathered a dataset containing physical attributes (such as Age, Weight, Height, Neck circumference, etc.) and corresponding body fat percentages.
Performed data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of variables, correlations, and potential outliers.
Visualized relationships between attributes and body fat percentage using graphs and charts.
# 3. Feature Engineering
Created new features, such as Body Mass Index (BMI), to capture additional insights from the data.
Split the dataset into predictor variables (attributes) and the target variable (body fat percentage).
# 4. Model Selection and Evaluation
Chose appropriate machine learning models for regression, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Utilized performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess model accuracy.
# 5. Model Deployment
Developed a user-friendly web application for body fat prediction using Flask, HTML, and CSS.
Integrated the trained model into the web application to enable users to input their physical attributes and receive a predicted body fat percentage.
